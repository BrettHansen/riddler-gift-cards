  <h2 align="center">Does Your Gift Card Still Have Free Drinks On It?</h2>
  <p class="quote">
    Lucky you! You've won two gift cards, each loaded with 50 free drinks from your favorite coffee shop, Riddler Caffei-Nation. The cards look identical, and because you're not one for record-keeping, you randomly pick one of the cards to pay with each time you get a drink. One day, the clerk tells you that he can't accept the card you presented to him because it doesn't have any drink credits left on it.
  </p>
  <p class="quote">
    What is the probability that the other card still has free drinks on it? How many free drinks can you expect are still available?
  </p>
  <p>
    This problem was posed <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/does-your-gift-card-still-have-free-drinks-on-it/">as part of FiveThirtyEight's weekly column, The Riddler</a>. What follows is my own solution.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's start with some notation. We can describe the state of your giftcards with the pair \(S_k=(a_k,b_k)\) respresenting the number of credits left on each card in iteration \(k\) (the \(k\)-th iteration is where you buy your \(k\)-th cup of coffee). Initially, the state of the system is \(S_0=(50,50)\).
  </p>
  <p>
    In each iteration, you randomly choose a card and attempt to purchase a drink with it &mdash; this corresponds to decrementing one of the two elements of the pair. For example, in the first iteration you may choose the left card of the pair, resulting in \(S_1=(49,50)\). Finally, let \(T_k\) be the total credits left on both cards so that \(T_k=a_k+b_k\).
  </p>
  <p>
    The questions ask about the <em>final</em> states of our system &mdash; those in which you attempted to use an empty gift card. Let us describe the final state of the system with the un-paramaterized variables \(S\) and \(T\). It follows that there are two types of final states:
    <ul>
      <li>
        A single state where <em>both</em> cards are empty, resulting in \(S=(0,0)\) and \(T=0\), and,
      </li>
      <li>
        The many states where one card still has some non-zero number of credits (e.g \(S=(1,0)\), \(T=1\)).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Non-final states always lead to two possible next states with equal probability. For example, from the state \(S_{22}=(40,28)\) you could either use a credit from the left card resulting in \(S_{23}=(39,28)\), or from the right card giving \(S_{23}=(40,27)\). Notice however, that you could have also arrived at \(S_{23}=(40,27)\) from the state \(S_{22}=(41,28)\).
  </p>
  <p>
    This naturally lends itself to a tree structure. Let's consider a smaller problem to make the notation simpler &mdash; suppose each card starts with 3 credits. We can construct a tree where each level represents an iteration of a problem, listing all the possible states in that iteration. We can simulate this problem by walking downward through the tree, with each step corresponding to choosing a card and purchasing a drink with it.

    In this diagram, the initial state \(S_0=(3,3)\) is at the top and the final states are bold. We can extend the diagram slightly so that all the final states occur in the final row. I will italicize states that are not actually valid, but lead to an appropriate final state in the final row.

  <p>
    Lots more explanation and diagrams...
  </p>
  <p>
    The probability the other card still has free drinks on it is given by \(\mathbb{P}(T>0)\), while the expected number of drinks remaining is simply \(\mathbb{E}[T]\).
  </p>
\begin{align}

\mathbb{P}(T>0)&=\binom{2n}{n}2^{-2n} \\
\mathbb{E}[T]&=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\binom{n+k}{k}(n-k)2^{-(n+k)} \\

\end{align}
  <p>
    With \(n=50\), we therefore have:
  </p>
\begin{align}

\mathbb{P}(T>0) &=\binom{100}{50}2^{-100} = \frac{100\ 891\ 344\ 545\ 564\ 193\ 334\ 812\ 497\ 256}{1\ 267\ 650\ 600\ 228\ 229\ 401\ 496\ 703\ 205\ 376} &\approx 0.0796 \\
\mathbb{E}[T]   &=\sum_{k=0}^{49}\binom{50+k}{k}(50-k)2^{-(50+k)} &\approx 7.0385 \\

\end{align}
